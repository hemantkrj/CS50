0.  It(String constant) has been used for maximumm length allowed for any word in the text. 

1. getrusage() returns resource usage measures for either calling process or its children or calling thread which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the process.  

2.  16
3.  C requires passing structs by reference in functions to avoid big size of structure to be passes because that would not be efficient.
4.   After loading a text and a dictionary, 
main() function starts reading a text character at a time, to construct separate words. 
A word is completed when one or more alphabetic symbols are read, and we see a non-alphanumeric character (like spacebar, or newline). 
Then we check our word against dictionary, set the word index to zero, and continue the loop. 
If we see a digit, or a string is longer than 45 chars, we traverse this word in the text, but we don't check it for misspellings.

5.  There are several problems with fscanf - first, we must allocate a memory for a string before reading it from file, 
and there are no limits of a length of a word in a text file. Also we can't write program for skipping alphanumeric words, like this implementation of speller has.

6.  Those parameters are never intented to be modified in the functions so they are declared as cnstant.
7.  TRIE.In a node,there are 2 fields.
    an array of children of type node with size equal to alphabet.
    boolean variable to mark the end of the word.
    
8.  It was quite fast as I used trie which is having time complexity of O(max length of a string) for insert(load) and search(check).
9.  No changes
10. I didn't find as long as it loads dictionary successfully and performs the checking efficiently.
