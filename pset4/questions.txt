0.  BMP-Variable, depends on the number of bits specified in the header.ex-32 bit,32 million colors
    GIF-8 bit,256 colors
    PNG-24 bit,16 million colors
    JPEG-24 bit,16 million colors
1.  GIF
2.  With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed
    With lossy compression,some of the data in the file is thrown away.
3.  JPEG
4.  The information in the address table is erased, but the file itself remains on the hard drive.
5.  We can delete files using Secure Delete option to replace section with all zeroes on the disk.
6.  stdint.h is a header file that defines a set of integral type aliases with specific width requirements, along with macros specifying their limits.

7.  We can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file which is good
    for things like bitmap headers.

8.  BYTE is 1 byte
	DWORD is 4 bytes
	LONG is 4 bytes
    WORD is 2 bytes
9.  The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. It must be
 	set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.

10. bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file.
    biSize is the number of bytes in the info header.
11. If biHeight is negative, the
     bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

12. biBitCount
13. If it can't find the file, it will return NULL.
14. it is because the program is reading in 1 RGB triple at a time
15. 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel = 9 bytes. 3 bytes are added to bring the scanline to 12 bytes.
16. It moves to a specific location in a file.

17. An integer constant which, when used as the 'whence' argument to the
fseek or fseeko function, specifies that the offset provided is relative to
the current file position.
18. A man wearing suit
